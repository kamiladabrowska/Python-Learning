#Enumerate: Write a program that asks the user for a sentence. Use enumerate() to print the index and character for every vowel in the sentence.
#zip(): Ask the user for two lists of numbers (comma-separated). Use zip() to calculate and print the sum of corresponding elements.
#List comprehension: Write a program that takes a list of words as input and creates a new list containing only words longer than 5 characters using a list comprehension.
#Loop with else: Write a program that takes a number as input and checks if it is divisible by any number from 2 to 9 using a for-else loop.
#Dictionary: Create a dictionary with product names as keys and their prices as values. Write a loop to print all products that cost more than $50.
#Filtering: Ask the user for a list of numbers (comma-separated). Filter out numbers less than 10 and print the remaining ones.
#itertools: Use itertools.cycle to create a program that alternates printing "Red", "Yellow", "Green" three times (to mimic a traffic light cycle)."""
